- [IfHasHTTPPut](#IfHasHTTPPut)
- [HTTPPutExcludeField](#[N]-HTTPPutExcludeField)
- [IfHasHTTPDelete](#IfHasHTTPDelete)
- [IfHasHTTPGet](#IfHasHTTPGet)
- [HTTPGetExcludeField](#[N]-HTTPGetExcludeField)
- [HTTPGetIncludeEntities](#[N]-HTTPGetIncludeEntities)
- [AutoIncludeReferencingEntities](#[N]-AutoIncludeReferencingEntities)
- [IsPagination](#IsPagination)
- [SortBy](#SortBy)
- [SortOrder](#SortOrder)

# EntityUniqueName
`string`

Required: Yes

Unique name of the entity.The foreign key of the Entity. 

# IfHasHTTPPost
`bool`

Default: Yes

If set to false, the interface provided by Autocoding is not used, and an error will be reported when calling the interface directly. But the project team can customize the interface implementation.

<details>
<summary>Example</summary>

Kb's Designs hopes that users will only use the existing ones and not add new ones, so if the entity's IfHasHTTPPost is configured as false, an error will be reported when the post interface is called, thereby realizing the effect of shielding the post interface.
