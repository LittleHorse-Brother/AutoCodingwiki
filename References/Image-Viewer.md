This configuration will add an API to download image content. For image configuration in some entities, we often have an option of system image or custom image. So, we provide some configuration to decide what image content should be displayed. Because entityâ€™s field is the actual storage structure in the corresponding database, we offer this configuration that will give a friendlier API.

# How to configure

For agent avatar, we have 3 fields to determine what the avatar should display. The 3 fields are `systemAvatarId`, `ifCustomizeAvatar` and `customizeAvatar`. And we want the avatar's api endpoint should be `/agents/{id}/avatar`. Therefore, we will set the properties for each fields as following:
  - entityUniqueName: `agent`
  - name: `avatar`
  - fieldForCustomImage: `customizeAvatar`
  - fieldForIsUseCustomImage: `ifCustomizeAvatar`
  - fieldForReferencingSystemImage: `systemAvatarId`

After these configurations are completed, there will be an additional property `avatar` under the agent entity. The value of this property will be a url to download this image. It will take a hash value in query (version). 

![agent-avatar.png](/.attachments/agent-avatar-bf7265f0-1295-4d26-b40b-9d6f7d594982.png)

The front-end can directly use this url to display the image. And the server will decide to display custom image or system image according to the actual configuration.
