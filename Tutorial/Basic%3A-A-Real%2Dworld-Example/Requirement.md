# About Blocked senders

Block sender is a feature of our `Ticketing` product. Ticketing is for handling messages from senders (customers). Blocking a sender means you can mark future messages from the sender as Junk, or simply stop polling messages from the sender.

You can create multiple blocked senders. Each blocked sender have below info:

1. Identity of the sender. Could be an `Email` or a `Domain`.

1. Block Level. What action will do when the system receives a message from a blocked sender.
   1. Mark future messages as junk
   1. Reject all future messages
