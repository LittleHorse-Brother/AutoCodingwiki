The two main configuration items used to configure include entity are [HTTPGetIncludeEntities](#https://dev.azure.com/Comm100/Auto%20Coding/_wiki/wikis/Auto-Coding.wiki/96/Entity-API?anchor=%5Bn%5D-httpgetincludeentities) and [AutoIncludeReferencingEntities](#https://dev.azure.com/Comm100/Auto%20Coding/_wiki/wikis/Auto-Coding.wiki/96/Entity-API?anchor=%5Bn%5D-autoincludereferencingentities).

We often encounter such a problem: 'I have configured the relevant properties of `include`, and there is no error in the return, but why can't I find it in the return result?'ï¼ŒIn this case, the association relationship between entities is generally not configured. You need to check your entity relationships.This configuration is implemented by fields of the entity's [reference](#https://dev.azure.com/Comm100/Auto%20Coding/_wiki/wikis/Auto-Coding.wiki/111/Field?anchor=reference) type.

<b>Notice: If this field is mapped to a database field, an `Id` will be added. For example, the category field of an article corresponds to a database table field, which is a categoryId. In the API parameter transfer and return results, an Id will also be added to the attribute name.</b>
